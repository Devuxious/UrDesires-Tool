# UrDesires-Tool

## Note: 
This project is no longer maintained and is unlikely to work due to Discord's patches and API changes. 
The code quality is also subpar as it was a rushed project. 

The UrDesires Boost Bot is a legacy project that was created to automate the process of boosting a Discord server using Nitro-enabled accounts. 
It allowed users to input their own Discord accounts with Nitro and quickly boost a server. 

Feel free to use it as a reference or for educational purposes, but please be aware of its limitations.
